# auto-pres

auto-pres is a tool that automatically creates presentations for your speeches.

auto-pres was created for the *Sementic Text Analysis* course in the 3rd semester of the master degree *Interactive Media* at the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg Campus](http://www-en.fh-ooe.at/hagenberg-campus).

## How it works
Using [aylien](http://aylien.com/), we analyse the uploaded speech – paragraph by paragraph – and then look for images on [google images](https://www.google.com/imghp) for each of them. These images are then combined into a presentation using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

The original paragraph is added as a note, these can be accessed by pressing `s` in the presentation.
